Dynamically Scaled Pong Game that can run on Web, Android, Windows, but works best on Android.
This project was really fun to make and I will continue making updates!
My personal touch was that I used a pixel art creator to make the paddle and ball sprites!
In Update 2.0, I added 2 Player PvP and a Player vs Computer mode with three difficulty options
